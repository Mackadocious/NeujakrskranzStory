The year was 2020 and I was sitting in my home, enjoying my morning bratwurst in my favorite pair of Lederhose watching the President announce that we were not allowed to leave our homes for the foreseeable future. 
I looked out my front window at the empty hauptstrasse and wondered if my life would ever be the same, and then suddenly a schnapsidee popped in my head.
Rammstein could pull off Schneewittchens's Lederhose and I would love nothing more than to be off in some Derndel in their Biergarten listening to Musik in Berlin, that was until 
I saw on the news that the hostile alien mothership had landed at the Berlin Flughafen.
The alien drove a wettbewerbsfaehig Bayerische Motoren Werke on the Hauptstrasse to the Rammstein show.
Upon arriving to the Rammstein show, there was a woman dressed as Schneewittchen dancing to Music.
When I asked her why she was dancing by herself outside, she said that the klimaanlage inside was not working.
She then spun in a circle and a random Brot appeared in her hand.
She prepared that Brot as a gift for Till Lindemann, the lead vocalist from Rammstein.
Who was very angry because his Klimaanlage had just broken.
That is why he took off his Lederhose and performed in Derndel.
Some thought this was a Schnapsidee but others thought it actually improved his Musik.
